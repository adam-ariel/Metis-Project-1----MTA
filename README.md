# Metis-Project-1----MTA
First Metis Project with MTA data

Problem statement: We're going to look at total number of entries and exits per station for the month of May 2017. Then we will plot those to look for a natural cut-off to isolate the ~20 busiest stations and then focus just on those. Then we'll identify the zip codes of those stations. Then we will use a external data set regarding income details for those zip codes. Finally we will look at entry and exit total by time, in four hour chunks from 7-23 (maybe per entrance), independantly for weekends and weekdays. We will use these to rank these stations for weekday or weekend soliciting by weighting the different factors using methods yet undetermined.
